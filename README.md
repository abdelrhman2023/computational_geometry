## Introduction
Welcome to the Convex Hull Algorithms Project! This project is a captivating journey into the realm of computational geometry, with a specific focus on Convex Hull computation. Convex Hulls are a fundamental concept with applications spanning image processing, robotics, and geographic information systems. This readme serves as your guide to understanding, utilizing, and contributing to the project.

## Project Overview
In this project, we delve into the concept of Convex Hulls, which represent the smallest convex set that encompasses a given shape within Euclidean space. Picture it as an elegant boundaryâ€”a resilient rubber band gracefully enveloping a bounded subset in the plane.

### Key Highlights:
- **Dual Perspectives:** We approach Convex Hulls from two unique angles: as the intersection of all convex sets containing a subset, and as the set of all possible convex combinations of points within the subset.
- **Implemented Algorithms:** Our project boasts seven meticulously implemented algorithms:
  1. Extreme Points
  2. Extreme Segments
  3. Jarvis March
  4. Quick Hull
  5. Graham Scan
  6. Incremental
  7. Divide and Conquer

## Implemented Algorithms
Here's a brief overview of each implemented algorithm:

1. **Extreme Points:** Identifies the core points that define the Convex Hull.
2. **Extreme Segments:** Traces the influential line segments that shape the Convex Hull.
3. **Jarvis March:** A graceful dance that encloses the subset with a convex embrace.
4. **Quick Hull:** Swiftly constructs the Convex Hull fortress.
5. **Graham Scan:** A strategic traversal that meticulously builds the Convex Hull.
6. **Incremental:** Witness the step-by-step evolution of the Convex Hull.
7. **Divide and Conquer:** A technique involving splitting, conquering, and merging for the ultimate in convexity.

## Usage
Each algorithm comes with its own set of usage instructions and examples. In-depth documentation is provided in the respective algorithm folders. You can run and experiment with the algorithms in your preferred programming language.
